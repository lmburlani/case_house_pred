# Intro

Hello there! First of all, thank you for applying for UAU's Data Scientist role. We have a lot of exciting stuff to build and we are glad you chose to apply. The goal of this quiz is to test your skills as a Data Scientist.

# Instructions

You will find a file as part of this zip named `house_sales.csv`. This file contains a dataset of housing sales from a specific region in the United States. Your goal is to build a model that best predicts housing prices from that region. We have sampled a test set out of the original dataset that we will use to grade your model.

- **You will have 24h from the moment we sent you this quiz**
- This test is not tied to a particular language or framework. You can use the tools you feel most comfortable with, however, **you must submit instructions as to how to run your code and build your model**.
- Getting to the *right* solution is not the most important thing here. We will evaluate each candidate on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration their level of expertise. **We mean it**.
- This test is supposed to mimic work in real life, therefore, feel free to look things up on the web
  - Feel free to use custom libraries you found on the web. Make sure you include them as part of your submission
  - If you find a solution to this specific problem when conducting your search, please report back to us immediately. We will use tools to automatically detect plagiarism and **candidates that submit plagiarized code will be rejected**

## Meaning of each column in the CSV file

- **price** - The last price the house was sold for
- **num_bed** - The number of bedrooms
- **num_bath** - The number of bathrooms (fractions mean the house has a toilet-only or shower/bathtub-only bathroom)
- **size_house** (includes basement) - The size of the house
- **size_lot** - The size of the lot
- **num_floors** - The number of floors
- **is_waterfront** - Whether or not the house is a waterfront house (0 means it is not a waterfront house whereas 1 means that it is a waterfront house)
- **condition** - How worn out the house is. Ranges from 1 (needs repairs all over the place) to 5 (the house is very well maintained)
- **size_basement** - The size of the basement
- **year_built** - The year the house was built
- **renovation_date** - The year the house was renovated for the last time. 0 means the house has never been renovated
- **zip** - The zip code
- **latitude** - Latitude
- **longitude** - Longitude
- **avg_size_neighbor_houses** - The average house size of the neighbors
- **avg_size_neighbor_lot** - The average lot size of the neighbors

## Submitting your Solution

In order to submit your solution, e-mail back to us a zip file with your code and instructions on how to run it in order to build the model. It is not necessary to send a copy of the dataset back to us.

We will e-mail you confirming we received your solution. Please allow us a week to reply back to you with our final decision.

## Pluses

One of the most important parts of a Data Scientist's job is to communicate his findings accordingly. Therefore, you will get extra credit if you submit a well organized notebook that shows the kind of data exploration you conducted and explains the rationale you used to build your model.
